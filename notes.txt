fping is a ping dependent streamlined version of ping. it saves users typing "-c" and that is it.
Originally written by WebDevPro for a tutorial, and reworked by me in September 2022 to run on OS X
i now have added cli support to it.

This project is not really designed for public consumption, as it is not really helpful, but is more of a simple instructional piece for:
-Mac OS X users trying to figure out how to use the native "os" library commands in a world of Windows tutorials
-Anyone wanting to learn how to accept command line arguments as modifiers for their python programs.

-Contributors/Credits-
1. WebDevPro (Original Windows version of the ping script this project is based on)
2. Killswitch5150 (Original OS X port of the script in September 2022, and the addition of CLI argument support)
